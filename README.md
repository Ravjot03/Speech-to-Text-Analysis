# Speech-to-Text-Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates automatic speech recognition (ASR) using OpenAI's Whisper Large v2 model. The notebook processes audio files, converts them into text, and provides transcriptions with time-stamped segments, making it a valuable resource for speech analysis tasks.

## Overview
This notebook showcases how to:

- Use the Hugging Face transformers library to load the OpenAI Whisper model.
- Process audio files and convert speech into text.
- Generate time-stamped transcription segments for detailed speech analysis.
- The openai/whisper-large-v2 model is designed for multi-language ASR and has state-of-the-art performance in speech recognition tasks. This notebook provides a user-friendly interface for working with the model and offers insights into handling speech data.


## Key Features
- **State-of-the-art ASR:** Uses OpenAI's Whisper Large v2 model, which provides high-quality transcriptions for multi-language speech recognition tasks.
- **Transcription of Audio Files:** Converts speech into text from audio files.
- **Time-Stamped Segments:** Breaks down the transcription into timestamped segments for better analysis.
- **Hugging Face Pipeline Integration:** Easy integration with Hugging Face's pipeline API for seamless speech recognition.
