# Speech-to-Text-Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates automatic speech recognition (ASR) using OpenAI's Whisper Large v2 model. The notebook processes audio files, converts them into text, and provides transcriptions with time-stamped segments, making it a valuable resource for speech analysis tasks.
