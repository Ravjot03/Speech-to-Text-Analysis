# Speech-to-Text-Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates automatic speech recognition (ASR) using OpenAI's Whisper Large v2 model. The notebook processes audio files, converts them into text, and provides transcriptions with time-stamped segments, making it a valuable resource for speech analysis tasks.

## Overview
This notebook showcases how to:

- Use the Hugging Face transformers library to load the OpenAI Whisper model.
- Process audio files and convert speech into text.
- Generate time-stamped transcription segments for detailed speech analysis.
- The openai/whisper-large-v2 model is designed for multi-language ASR and has state-of-the-art performance in speech recognition tasks. This notebook provides a user-friendly interface for working with the model and offers insights into handling speech data.
